# assistant-fuse
Another Rubik's Cube trainer, this time on mobile.

## attribution
assistant-fuse uses [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com/) and [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), and its visual design is based on [Skeleton 2.0.4](http://getskeleton.com/).

Most of the algorithms used (including the diagrams) are from [Bob Burton's cubewhiz.com](http://www.cubewhiz.com/). There were a few that were swapped out/rotated at some point; unfortunately I don't remember when or where they came from.

For the web-based parent/sister project, see [assistant](https://github.com/yupferris/assistant).
